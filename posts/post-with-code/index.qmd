In this post, I will introduce the project and give a summary for what I have been up to the past few weeks! 

This past week I have been working on a data exploration file in Power BI because it was the most convient tool for the job. Power BI is microsoft's data visualization tool and is the tool of business nerds. I have created some an exploration table full of potential features for potential ML model which will be done in python. I also conducted some simple statistical tests to see if there was a significant difference between the different demographic data and the percent of praxis test passed. 

The first thing I decided to explore was general demographic data for each student in a group, and took the average GPA for each group and the percentage of students who passed their Praxis Test. Upon doing this, I decided to run multiple seperate ANOVA tests to see whether there was a difference between the groups and their percent of praxis tests passed.
