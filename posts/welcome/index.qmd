This is the first post in a Luke's Senior Project Blog!

Here we will learn more about Luke's senior project in data science as well as some other tips and tricks learned along the way. 

First things first, we need to go over what not to do when the semester starts and you are taking senior project. 

This is my final semester here at BYUI and I had a good amount of time to create ideas for a senior project, write a proposal, and execute that plan, however some unforseen circumstances changed all that. 

In short, I put off starting a senior project until about five weeks into a fourteen week semester, but this did not go without a fight. During those first four weeks I worked hard to find a project, but nothing panned out. People did not know when they would get the data and other project would require certain approvals that would take too long to get.  

The nice thing is that things always seem to have a way of working out. At the last minute a project rolled in to help another professor with their EdD dissertaion and I jumped on it. It will be this project that I will be reporting on in this blog for the next ten weeks. I look forward to taking this journey with you!
