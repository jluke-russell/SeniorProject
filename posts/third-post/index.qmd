A majority of this project has consisted of data wrangling (cleaning) and for this project, I did most of my data wrangling using the R programming language. 

Data wrangling is an important skill for any data analyst/scientist becuase it allows them to mold the data into a usable format and standardize the data to make it functional. Another aspect of data wrangling is creating new datasets that contain data from multiple sources. Typcially you would want to do this step in the program that originally holds the data like a SQL database, but since I recieved the data secondhand, I also had to perform this step using R.  

I first started with the main dataset (called main) and created a new column called percPassed or the percentage of Praxis tests passed by students, and called this main2. Then I created the evaluation dataset, called result, by joining the Danielson and Disposition datasets by the 'StudentID' column.

The main cleaning consisted of changing categorical data into numerical values to calculate averages and perform analysis. This was done by using the mutate statement and case when statements to make the changes I needed as a sample is shown below:

Following these steps, I then joined the result2 dataset to the main2 dataset to create my full_data. I then joined the certification data to create my final full_data dataset to be used for the intial analysis.

The penultamate step of the main data wrangling was to create the average evaluation ratings for the Danielson and Disposition evaluations, and this is why I had to mutate the data into numeric values. 

To accomplish this task I created two vectors that included the names of all the evaluation columns then used the rowMeans function in R to find the average of all the columns in the vectors for each row. I then added these two new columns to the full_data dataset.

The final step of the data wrangling was to create a smaller dataset with select student majors. These majors were the majors that a majority of students within the full_data dataset have declared, and I will be using this dataset for my final poster presentation too.

To conlcude, data wrangling is crucial because real-world data is often messy, incomplete, or in a format unsuitable for analysis. It involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing data to enhance its quality and structure. This process ensures that data is ready for analysis, enabling more accurate and reliable insights to be derived from it. Effective data wrangling simplifies the analysis process, improves the accuracy of results, and ultimately supports informed decision-making.
