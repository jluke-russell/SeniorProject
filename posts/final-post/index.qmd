Well friends, we've officically reached the end of the line! 

This is my last post reporting on the progress of my senior project to assist in the analysis of the BYU-Idaho Teacher Education program. I capped of this semester with a poster presentation at the BYU-Idaho Research and Creative Works (RCW) conference held back on December 7th, and wrapped up my role as consultant by turning my exploratory analysis file in Power BI into a functional dashboard that can be deployed as an app if desired.
