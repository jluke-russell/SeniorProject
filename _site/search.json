During those first four weeks I worked hard to find a project, but nothing panned out. People did not know when they would get the data and other project would require certain approvals that would take too long to get.\nThe nice thing is that things always seem to have a way of working out. At the last minute a project rolled in to help another professor with their EdD dissertaion and I jumped on it. It will be this project that I will be reporting on in this blog for the next ten weeks. I look forward to taking this journey with you!"
