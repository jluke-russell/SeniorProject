    "text": "This is the first post in a Luke’s Senior Project Blog!\n\nHere we will learn more about Luke’s senior project in data science as well as some other tips and tricks learned along the way.\nFirst things first, we need to go over what not to do when the semester starts and you are taking senior project.\nThis is my final semester here at BYUI and I had a good amount of time to create ideas for a senior project, write a proposal, and execute that plan, however some unforseen circumstances changed all that.\nIn short, I put off starting a senior project until about five weeks into a fourteen week semester, but this did not go without a fight. During those first four weeks I worked hard to find a project, but nothing panned out. People did not know when they would get the data and other project would require certain approvals that would take too long to get.\nThe nice thing is that things always seem to have a way of working out. At the last minute a project rolled in to help another professor with their EdD dissertaion and I jumped on it. It will be this project that I will be reporting on in this blog for the next ten weeks. I look forward to taking this journey with you!"

    "text": "In this post, I will introduce the project and give a summary for what I have been up to the past few weeks!\nThis past week I have been working on a data exploration file in Power BI because it was the most convient tool for the job. Power BI is microsoft’s data visualization tool and is the tool of business nerds. I have created some an exploration table full of potential features for potential ML model which will be done in python. I also conducted some simple statistical tests to see if there was a significant difference between the different demographic data and the percent of praxis test passed.\nThe first thing I decided to explore was general demographic data for each student in a group, and took the average GPA for each group and the percentage of students who passed their Praxis Test. Upon doing this, I decided to run multiple seperate ANOVA tests to see whether there was a difference between the groups and their percent of praxis tests passed.\n\nUpon running a number of ANOVA tests on the main data, I found that all my ANOVA ended up being significant, meaning that there is a statistical difference between the percent of praxis tests passed between the groups selected."

    "title": "Data Cleaning",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A majority of this project has consisted of data wrangling (cleaning) and for this project, I did most of my data wrangling using the R programming language.\nData wrangling is an important skill for any data analyst/scientist becuase it allows them to mold the data into a usable format and standardize the data to make it functional. Another aspect of data wrangling is creating new datasets that contain data from multiple sources. Typcially you would want to do this step in the program that originally holds the data like a SQL database, but since I recieved the data secondhand, I also had to perform this step using R.\nI first started with the main dataset (called main) and created a new column called percPassed or the percentage of Praxis tests passed by students, and called this main2. Then I created the evaluation dataset, called result, by joining the Danielson and Disposition datasets by the ‘StudentID’ column.\n\nThe main cleaning consisted of changing categorical data into numerical values to calculate averages and perform analysis. This was done by using the mutate statement and case when statements to make the changes I needed as a sample is shown below:\n\nFollowing these steps, I then joined the result2 dataset to the main2 dataset to create my full_data. I then joined the certification data to create my final full_data dataset to be used for the intial analysis.\n\nThe penultamate step of the main data wrangling was to create the average evaluation ratings for the Danielson and Disposition evaluations, and this is why I had to mutate the data into numeric values.\nTo accomplish this task I created two vectors that included the names of all the evaluation columns then used the rowMeans function in R to find the average of all the columns in the vectors for each row. I then added these two new columns to the full_data dataset.\n\nThe final step of the data wrangling was to create a smaller dataset with select student majors. These majors were the majors that a majority of students within the full_data dataset have declared, and I will be using this dataset for my final poster presentation too.\n\nTo conlcude, data wrangling is crucial because real-world data is often messy, incomplete, or in a format unsuitable for analysis. It involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing data to enhance its quality and structure. This process ensures that data is ready for analysis, enabling more accurate and reliable insights to be derived from it. Effective data wrangling simplifies the analysis process, improves the accuracy of results, and ultimately supports informed decision-making."

    "text": "Well friends, we’ve officically reached the end of the line!\nThis is my last post reporting on the progress of my senior project to assist in the analysis of the BYU-Idaho Teacher Education program. I capped of this semester with a poster presentation at the BYU-Idaho Research and Creative Works (RCW) conference held back on December 7th, and wrapped up my role as consultant by turning my exploratory analysis file in Power BI into a functional dashboard that can be deployed as an app if desired.\nThe presentation at the RCW went really well, I had many friends and mentors visit my poster and some fellow data scientists as well. My favorite part of RCW was being able to share my work with others and help them understand my thought process and recieve feedback as to how to improve. What helped me the most on this project was my classes I took: Math 325, Math 326, BA 315, and DS 350. The skills taught in these classes were critical to my success in the final product."
