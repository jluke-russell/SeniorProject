    "text": "This is the first post in a Luke’s Senior Project Blog!\n\nHere we will learn more about Luke’s senior project in data science as well as some other tips and tricks learned along the way.\nFirst things first, we need to go over what not to do when the semester starts and you are taking senior project.\nThis is my final semester here at BYUI and I had a good amount of time to create ideas for a senior project, write a proposal, and execute that plan, however some unforseen circumstances changed all that.\nIn short, I put off starting a senior project until about five weeks into a fourteen week semester, but this did not go without a fight. During those first four weeks I worked hard to find a project, but nothing panned out. People did not know when they would get the data and other project would require certain approvals that would take too long to get.\nThe nice thing is that things always seem to have a way of working out. At the last minute a project rolled in to help another professor with their EdD dissertaion and I jumped on it. It will be this project that I will be reporting on in this blog for the next ten weeks. I look forward to taking this journey with you!"

    "text": "In this post, I will introduce the project and give a summary for what I have been up to the past few weeks!\nThis past week I have been working on a data exploration file in Power BI because it was the most convient tool for the job. Power BI is microsoft’s data visualization tool and is the tool of business nerds. I have created some an exploration table full of potential features for potential ML model which will be done in python. I also conducted some simple statistical tests to see if there was a significant difference between the different demographic data and the percent of praxis test passed.\nThe first thing I decided to explore was general demographic data for each student in a group, and took the average GPA for each group and the percentage of students who passed their Praxis Test. Upon doing this, I decided to run multiple seperate ANOVA tests to see whether there was a difference between the groups and their percent of praxis tests passed.\n\nUpon running a number of ANOVA tests on the main data, I found that all my ANOVA ended up being significant, meaning that there is a statistical difference between the percent of praxis tests passed between the groups selected."
